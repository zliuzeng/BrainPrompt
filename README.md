###  **Project Structure and Pipeline Overview**

This project follows a four-step pipeline for domain adaptation on multi-site brain network data:

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Download and Preprocessing

Downloads raw ABIDE dataset from the public repository. Preprocesses the data, including time series extraction and functional connectivity construction.

data_process.py ABIDE_download.py

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Pretraining on Source Domains

Trains a baseline model on aggregated source domains for initialization. Contains the architecture of the baseline network used for initial training.

baseline_train.py  baseline_model.py

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Source Domain Learning and Similarity Computation

**3.1 **Trains the prompt-based model on selected source domains. Defines the prompt-based model structure used in source domain learning.

source_train.py source_model.py

**3.2 **Computes the similarity between different domains (e.g., feature distance) to guide prompt transfer.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Target Domain Adaptation

Performs adaptation in the target domain using few-shot prompt tuning. Defines the model architecture used for target-domain adaptation.
