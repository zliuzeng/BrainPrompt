###  **Project Structure and Pipeline Overview**

This project follows a four-step pipeline for domain adaptation on multi-site brain network data:

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Download and Preprocessing

Downloads raw ABIDE dataset from the public repository. Preprocesses the data, including time series extraction and functional connectivity construction.

data_process.py ABIDE_download.py

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Pretraining on Source Domains

Trains a baseline model on aggregated source domains for initialization. Contains the architecture of the baseline network used for initial training.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Source prompts Learning

**3.1 Training Source Mask Prompts**

**3.2 Computing Domain Similarity Scores and Integrating Mask Prompts**

**3.3 Training Source Domain Embeddings**

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Target Domain Adaptation

Performs adaptation in the target domain using few-shot prompt tuning. Defines the model architecture used for target-domain adaptation.
